# Changelog

All notable changes to fettle are recorded here. Newest first.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] — remote AI upgrade-check

- **`fettle remote HOST upgrade-check`** — the experimental AI pre-upgrade advisor
  now works against a remote host. fettle collects a redacted snapshot **on the
  host** (read-only, no sudo, no API key) and runs the Claude analysis **on your
  machine** with your local key. Your key never leaves your machine, only your
  machine needs internet to Anthropic, and the report is saved locally as
  `~/upgrade-check-<host>.txt`. (Replaces the old behaviour, which ran the whole
  thing on the remote and wanted your key set there.) Missing `inxi` on the host
  degrades gracefully; on Debian the pending list reflects the host's cached apt
  data (Arch uses a fresh rootless sync).

## [0.4.5] — correctness & safety review fixes

_All items below were flagged and fixed during a Claude Fable 5 review of the
whole codebase._

- **User config is honoured on elevated runs.** `--config` is now carried across
  the `sudo` re-exec. Previously `sudo` reset `HOME=/root`, so system-changing
  runs re-resolved the config path to `/root`'s (usually absent) and silently used
  built-in defaults — ignoring your `keep_orphans`, `exclude_foreign`, and
  `[updaters]` exactly when they matter (e.g. orphan removal).
- **A missing external tool no longer crashes the run.** `command.run` returns a
  clean non-zero result instead of raising `FileNotFoundError`.
- **No spurious sudo prompt in read-only/dry-run queries.** `sudo -u <user>` is
  only used when actually running as root (it can't drop privileges you don't
  hold), so unprivileged queries like the `yay -Qua` preview run directly.
- **Vanilla Arch / EndeavourOS `update` no longer fails** on the Manjaro-only
  `pacman-mirrors` — it's now skipped when absent.
- **Root-owned cache/state no longer crashes a later user run.** The AUR IOC cache
  and maintainer snapshots degrade gracefully if unreadable, and are chowned back
  to the invoking user after a root run writes them.
- **Security: the remote zipapp** is uploaded to the remote user's `$HOME` under a
  random name (was a predictable world-writable `/tmp` path run under `sudo`).
- **`aur-precheck` never silently drops a package name** — everything after `--`
  is taken literally.

## [0.4.4] — Python rebuild check no longer flags Python itself

- **`-y` / `python-rebuild-check` ignores Python interpreter packages.** It used
  to list packages like `python312` (a separate, deliberately-installed Python
  interpreter) as "needing rebuild" just because they own `/usr/lib/python3.12`.
  Now the interpreter that owns an old Python dir is excluded (via its stdlib
  owner + a name-pattern fallback), so only genuinely **stranded modules** are
  flagged. Old Python dirs owned by *no* package are reported separately as
  removable leftover cruft, and skipped interpreters are named for transparency.

## [0.4.3] — kernel-removal safety fix

- **Debian/Ubuntu: never offer to remove the *newest* kernel.** Kernel management
  protected only the *running* kernel, so after a kernel upgrade before reboot
  (running the old kernel, newer one installed) it offered to purge the newer,
  next-boot kernel — a potential rollback. It now protects the running kernel
  **and** the newest installed one(s), compared numerically (a string sort ranks
  `6.8.0-99` above `6.8.0-124`), and nudges you to reboot when a newer kernel is
  installed but not yet active. Arch/Manjaro was audited and is unaffected
  (removal is user-named; the running series is refused).

## [0.4.2] — fixes

- **`fettle upgrade` now works** as a synonym for `update` (install package
  upgrades). The `--upgrade` flag already worked; the bare word didn't.

## [0.4.1] — fixes

- **Fixed the post-update AUR hint.** The Arch update summary pointed at
  `fettle -A -S`, a pre-v0.4.0 combo — since `-S` is now sys-audit, running it
  errored. It now correctly suggests `fettle -A -I` (AUR audit + IoC scan).
- **Clearer error for clashing shortcuts.** Combining a dispatch shortcut with an
  action flag (e.g. `fettle -A -S`) now prints a clear message instead of a
  cryptic sub-parser error; sub-options like `-S --list` still pass through.
- **`fettle sys-audit` with no arguments runs all checks** (was a "nothing to
  check" no-op) — matching `fettle -S`. Named categories and `--list` unchanged;
  the `remote` form still requires explicit categories/`--all`.
- **Debian/Ubuntu: autoremove previews first.** `apt-get autoremove` now lists the
  exact packages it would drop **before** asking, instead of confirming blind.

## [0.4.0] — CLI rework (breaking)

A **hard break** that reorganizes the command-line surface. Update any scripts,
aliases, or config files that used the old names.

**Switches — renamed / moved:**

| What | Old | New |
|---|---|---|
| config-file drift | `-p` / `--pacnew` | `-d` / `--config-drift` |
| AUR IoC scan | `-S` / `--aur-ioc-scan` | `-I` / `--aur-ioc-scan` |
| rebuild check | `--rebuilds` | `-r` / `--rebuild-check` |
| python rebuild check | `--python-rebuild` | `-y` / `--python-rebuild-check` |
| firmware check | `--firmware` (action `firmware`) | `-f` / `--firmware` (action `firmware-check`) |
| kernel | action `kernels` | `-k` / action `kernel` |
| package audit | `fettle pkg-audit` (word only) | `-P` / `--pkg-audit` (+ word) |
| upgrade | `-u` | `-u` / `--update` / `--upgrade` |

**New:**
- `-O` / `--only-update` — **safe metadata refresh + "what's upgradable" report**,
  no upgrade. Arch previews from a private cache (never `pacman -Sy`, so no
  partial-upgrade risk); Debian runs `apt update` + flatpak metadata.
- **Dispatch shortcuts** for the subcommand-style actions (subcommand forms stay
  for their options): `-S` → `sys-audit --all`, `-U` → `upgrade-check`, `-p` →
  `aur-precheck`.
- **`clean` now asks once** before deleting caches (`--yes` skips).
- **`aur-precheck` with no package** now scans *all* installed AUR packages (bare
  `fettle aur-precheck` / `-p` used to print nothing).

**`fettle remote` reworked** — `fettle remote [--ssh-arg X]... HOST <any
action/flags…>`. Everything after `HOST` is forwarded verbatim, so the whole CLI
works remotely. With no action named it still runs only the safe set
(`clean update firmware-check`), even under `--yes`.

**Config:**
- `default_actions` renamed to the new action names (`rebuild-check`,
  `python-rebuild-check`, `config-drift`, `firmware-check`). Old names are dropped
  with a warning pointing at the new spelling; hyphens and underscores both work.
- Removed the redundant `source_audit` action; `integrity` is now solely the
  `sys-audit` *packages* module.

**Removed:** old switches/long-options above no longer exist (they error rather
than silently doing something else).
